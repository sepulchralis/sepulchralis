**BYI:**
- we are a fictive heavy system of about 60, give or take. usually it's just our mcyt alters on pt for some reason, but our host (henry) is usually in co!
- you can ask to talk someone but we can't tell you with 100% certainty that they'll show up. you've got maybe a 40% chance of someone actually coming to front if you ask
- that being said, do NOT under any circumstances try to purposefully trigger anyone out, especially if they're IWC/IWEC (such as traumaholders, syskids and littles, or persecutors/prosecutors/etc) we WILL block you if you try that shit
- in addition, we block freely. if you harass us or people around us, you'll be blocked and/or hidden. we don't care. the button is there for a reason. our identity isn't a fucking debate.
- we're all generally fine with touch unless specified otherwise! we're fine with hugs/cuddles/boops/etc
- we're also cool with doubles, a lot of us aren't heavily attached to source so it's not really weird for us lol
- collectively we're generally arospec, and even those who aren't don't want to date. we're not interested in dating. please do not genuinely flirt with any of us. we will block you.
- all that being said, we do like interacting with people!! please don't be put off if we're dry at first, we're just autistic and struggle with tone :]

  .

**DNI:**
- anti neopronouns/xenogenders
- anti educated self diagnosis
- if you are in any way involved with shit like r/fakedisordercringe, get a life dude
- if you want to debate with me about my identity, i do not CARE
- endogenic systems, please look into getting help as you may be experiencing symptoms of another disorder!!
- if you have an issue with tone tags
